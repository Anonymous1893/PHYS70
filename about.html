                Me: My name is Azhaan! I am a Visiting Undergraduate Student (VUS) on exchange here for a semester and I'm trying to get a taste for all the things I love but can't really do back home.

                Back home: Iâ€™m currently a Doctor of Medicine student finishing my 3rd year of a 5-year undergraduate program at Western Sydney University. In university I have finished the biomedical sciences focussed (also known as pre-clinical) years and spent the last year completing rotations at a teaching hospital. These rotations included surgery, anaesthetics, internal medicine, emergency, and family practice.

                I have always put great emphasis on doing as many fun, "out there" things as possible and finding places to grow that don't have a default space in my medical course. I'm really keen to grow a richer knowledge-base in the art of tinkering and electronics.
