                        Me: My name is Azhaan! I am a Visiting Undergraduate Student (VUS) on exchange here for a semester and I'm trying to get a taste for all the things I love but can't really do back home.
                    </p>

                        Back home: Iâ€™m a medical student at Western Sydney University and just finished my third year, my first full year in hospital rotations! I also play a little bit of guitar (30 minutes every three months) and have been trying to lean more into my artsy side through digital art and photography.
