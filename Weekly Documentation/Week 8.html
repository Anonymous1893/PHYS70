				For this week I tried my hand at modeling BT21&#39;s favorite lil guy:
			</p>

			<p>
				I had initially hoped to make a 3D silicone version of his head so I
				made this model! It was really interesting working with so many curved
				lines and soft shapes in Fusion, the fillet and spline tools were my
				best friends through this process.
			</p>

				I ended up deciding to make a little desk tray modeled around his
				gorgeous face. I turned it 2D and put into the CNC milling machine! The
				heart was the main component so I used most of the 13mm depth for that
				(8mm deep) and an extra 2mm for the eyes and mouth. Here&#39;s how it
				turned out!
			</p>

			<p>
				It looks exactly as cute as I hoped and even though it&#39;s made with
				pocket cuts from the DXF I made, the edges are curved because of the
				bit. That worked perfectly for me though.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since the tray I wanted is also a negative, I tried my hand at vacuum
				forming and creating a plaster mold too! The vacuum formed mold ended up
				being a lot shallower than I would have wanted, probably because the
				plastic had trouble bending around the thing pocket cuts of the eyes. I
				would have preferred to mold a positive and then filled it in from
				underneath and not using the negative to begin with. This likely
				wasn&#39;t in line with how the vacuum former is intended to be used.
			</p>

			<p>
				Nevertheless I gave the plastering a shot and it still came out really
				cute! It&#39;s nice how subtle the curves are, it&#39;s grown on me. I
				initially had the ratios for water and plaster wrong but Kassia was nice
				enough to help me with that. I added a bit of red paint to the mixture
				for the pink tone as well! I accidentally overfilled the mold so
				there&#39;s a bit of an edge around it which I sanded off after this
				photo was taken.

			<p>I think this is still a success!</p>
