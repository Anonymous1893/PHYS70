			<p>
				For our drawing robot we wanted to create something that could recreate
				pixel art. Our base goal was to create a robot that would use a stamp of
				sorts to create squares imprints on a page, creating a &quot;grid&quot;
				of stamps to form an image.
			</p>
			<p>This project required 3 main parts</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Assembling a frame to move our &quot;stamp&quot; on a 2x2 grid</li>
				<li>Controlling the Stepper Motors to move through that grid</li>
				<li>Getting the end effector (stamp) to end effect (step)</li>
				<li>
					Integrate all the parts
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="creating-the-frame-">Creating the Frame:</h3>
			<p>
				For this step we used this
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tGBE674HGU">assembly</a> as
				our inspiration. Having two total stepper motors to control the movement
				with a belt helping with advancing the jig.
			</p>
			<p>
				There were three main challenges with assembling this. The first
				challenge was learning how to assemble components at all, getting used
				to working with aluminum extrusion and the existing pieces we had access
				to. There was a big mental click we had to make to move from creating 3D
				printed assemblies to working with larger projects that required 3D
				printing not for their construction but for interfacing pieces more
				securely.
			</p>

				<div><img src = "../images/drawbot/3d 222.jpg" width = 100%></div>
			</div> <br>

			<p>
				The second challenge was creating the second axis of motion. Advancing
				the centre black aluminum extrusion was fairly doable but advancing the
				end effector along that extrusion proved to be more difficult.

					<p>
						Initially we were going to draw on the design in the video mentioned
						above and we created 2 gears that would translate the rotation to
						between the two axes. This proved to be much more difficult to actually
						mount than &quot;securely attaching&quot; the second stepper motor to
						the X-axis
					</p>
				</div>
			</div> <br>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<p>
				The third challenge was creating a piece that can move along a threaded
				rod. We created two main pieces to help with this. The first was used to
				fix the threaded lead screw caps in a way that would advance if the rod
				was turned. The second was to do the same but to advance the end
				effector, requiring a moving attachment. This was fun to design

				Controlling the Stepper Motors
			</h3>
			<p>
				We had hoped that the stepper motors would be easy to work with since
				the other motors we had worked with were reasonably straight forward
				too. Simply getting the steppers to turn required significantly more
				wiring and trial and error.

			</div> <br>
			<p>
				After a few hours we stumbled upon the correct configuration through
				sheer luck and were finally able to get the stepper motor to go from
				BBBZZZZZZZZZZ and ZZPP ZPPP ZZZP to rotating smoothly through the steps.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once this was done we created a soldered board that had much more
				reliable connections:

			<h3 id="getting-the-stamp-to-stamp">Getting the stamp to stamp</h3>
			<p>
				Work on the stamp was moving parallel to the rest of the assembly. We
				were able to get the solenoid to move up and down and created a mount
				for it too.
			</p>
			<p>
				The silicone for the stamp was a decent enough stamp and we were able to
				get an inkpad for the stamp to &quot;re-ink&quot; itself
			</p>
			<h3 id="integrating-the-components">Integrating the components</h3>
			<p>
				This was where we met our end. Integrating all of this requires all of
				these individual components to be able to work together AND also
				requires programming to turn a grid into a traversable path for the
				robot.
			</p>
			<p>
				We weren&#39;t able to move past getting the physical components to work
				together.
			</p>
			<p>
				Trying to get the stepper motor to actually turn the rods was an issue. There were issed
				Our guess is that there&#39;s too much friction on the Y-axis rods
				because the X-axis rod was turning fairly successfully. We know that at
				least the stepper motors are working. We were able to also get the Y-axis rods to turn under very
				specific conditions. We needed to hold the motor really tight and needed to also put extra
				tension on the belt.
			</p>
			<p>
				We unfortunately didn&#39;t have the time to make it past this step but
				will be continuing the effort over the coming weeks (if we have the time).
