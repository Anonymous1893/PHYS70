<h1 id="process">Process</h1>
<p>Creating this Final Project was definitely a process. One that I am really proud of.</p>
<p>If you look at some of the early weeks from this website, you&#39;ll see that most of my focus was on the Sisyphus component. i.e. making a robot that can climb stairs. I don&#39;t think I had a good idea for difficult that would be until halfway through the semester, as you can see in my MVP reflection.</p>
<p>This is the direction the walking bots were going:</p>

<p>Focussing on the stairs, the movement, and the Pomodoro half of the project was the best decision I made for it. I ended up spending my &quot;skill points&quot; really honing in on the enclosure and the programming and not spending so much time on the complexities of creating a walking robot (especially at the scale of the escalator I made).</p>
<p>The first part was getting the LCD to work! Working with I2C was fun and I got to play </p>

<p>I then got set on working on the escalator mechanism. I was able to find a 3D model for the escalator <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6474393/files">here</a> and used CAD around it to make the housing for the screen and buttons. Here are the gears and some photos of the CAD for the housing I added around it! There was a decent amount of iteration I needed to do to get the button widths and press fit sizes exactly right, but it was worth it for how great the final assembly looked</p>

<p>I ended up spending a good amount of this project on making this assembly robust and it&#39;s something I&#39;m really happy with. While he may not be pushing a boulder up the hill, I can say that Sisyphus is definitely happy.</p>
