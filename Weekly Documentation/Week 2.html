        <h2>Week 2 - 2D Design and Cutting!</h2>

        <h3>The Story So Far...</h3>

        <h4>Attempt 1</h4>
        <p>
            Small box with no kerf, doesn't hold together but printed well!
            Had a bit of trouble with the Laser Cutter
        </p>

        <h4>Attempt 2</h4>
        <p>
            Forgot to change the material settings<br>
            Scoring lines didn't really score
        </p>

        <h4>Attempt 3</h4>
        <p>
            Kerf was too big!
            Also the folds for the scoring were weird
            Next version will be at 45 degrees to see if I can avoid that!
        </p>

        <h4>Attempt 4</h4>
        <p>
            Kerf was a teensie bit too small ://
            The 45 degree thing worked though! It looks so good
        </p>
