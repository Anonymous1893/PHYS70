        <h4 id="a-brief-reflection">A brief reflection</h4>
        <p>I&#39;ve taken this week as a chance to reflect on the progress I&#39;ve made towards my final project and decide whether or not I&#39;m happy with the direction it&#39;s heading in.</p>
        <p>My original idea had a sisyphus advancing up a set of stairs or a ramp taking however long I decided he would. i.e. climbing the stairs in 10 minutes or in 25 minutes in total. This would then be followed by a reset where he starts again from the bottom for the next timer.</p>
        <p>This movement was going to be a physical representation of getting closer and closer to the goal of reaching the end of a focus session.</p>
        <p>Now that I am getting closer to finishing my current version of the Sisyphus, I am seeing that it doesn&#39;t align with my goals and the reasons for those goals. It&#39;s still very cool but just not something I feel strongly about.</p>
        <p>This week I&#39;ll try and see it through till the end and get an MVP out of it and take this time to also decide what the final version will look like. The second half of the semester will be where I work on the final final project.</p>
